# Contributing

We welcome contributions of any sort - bug reports, enhancements, pull requests etc.

Please use the GitHub [issues tracker](https://github.com/andrewguy/structmap/issues) to flag potential bugs or improvements.

## Pull requests

Feel free to make a pull request with any suggested changes/bugfixes/improvements, although it would be best to flag any major work in an issue tracker before making a pull request.

A pull request will generally **not** be accepted if it does not include the appropriate unit tests. If this is an issue (i.e. if you're unsure how to write a unit test), feel free to discuss in an issue tracker - we can probably work something out. All tests should pass before you submit a pull request.

All Python code should follow [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If any existing code breaks PEP8 guidelines (without good reason), we beg forgiveness, and would welcome any pull requests to rectify this.
